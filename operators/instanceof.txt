instanceof it works on the level of prototypes. In particular, it tests to see if the right operand appears anywhere in the prototype chain of the left. instanceof doesn’t work with primitive types. It instanceof operator checks the current object and returns true if the object is of the specified type.

var dog = new Animal();
dog instanceof Animal; // Output : true

var name = new String("xyz");
name instanceof String; // Output : true
